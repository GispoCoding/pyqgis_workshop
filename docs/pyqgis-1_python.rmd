# Python basics

## Types, structures

For beginners to Python, pay special attention to indentations.

```{python}

# dynamically typed, so this is ok:

i = 1
i = 'string'
i = ['list item 1', 2, True]

print("lists are mutable. indexing starts at 0:", i)
i[0] = False
print(i)


t = (1, 2, 3, 4)  # tuples are not mutable

# errors are handled in the following way:
try:
    t[1] = 1
except TypeError:
    print("Trying to change tuples causes a TypeError")
finally:
    # you can also run some code after try-except finishes
    pass

a = t[0]

# basic logical operators

if a == 1:
    print("t[0] is 1")
elif a == 2:
    print("t[0] is 2")
else:
    print("t[0] is something else")

s = 'text'
# loops and iteration:

for character in s:
    print(character)

for idx, character in enumerate(s):
    print(idx, character)

i = 0
while True:
    print("this runs forever")
    print(s)
    i += 1
    if i >= 2:
        print(f"i value {i} >= 2, breaking")
        break  # breaks loop


# use pathlib to handle paths - it's generally better than os.path
from pathlib import Path
p = Path("/home/mikael/git")

# fstrings are strings with f-prefix: f"text" and can contain variables
# they are easy to use
# also note: it's easy to split strings to multiple lines if they are
# inside ( )

print("\"fstrings\" are strings that can contain variables "
      f"such as i={i}. you can also check if path p=Path({p}) exists "
      f"inside an fstring by using p.exists(): {p.exists()}")

d = {}  # dictionaries are commonly defined inside { }
d = dict(k1=i, pth=p)  # or, a bit more uncommonly, like this
print(d)
del d

# dictionaries store key-value pairs and are useful in many situations

d = {
    "key 1": "value 1",
    2: 2,
    "key 3": 3,
    4: {
        "a dict inside a dict": True,
    },
    5: ['lists', 'work', 'too']
}

for key in d:
    print(f"key: {key}, value: {d[key]}")


```

## Functions, classes, methods

```{python}

# functions are defined like so:

def function_name(param_1, param_2):
    c = param_1 + param_2
    return c

# it's a *good idea* to add type definitions to your functions!
# also pay attention to how you name your functions,
# document your functions,
# and follow naming conventions also with variables/parameters

def underscore_to_space(text: str) -> str:
    """ This function removes underscores from text
    :param text: input text
    :returns: text with underscores converted to spaces """

    return text.replace("_", " ")


# with PyQGIS you'll mostly work with classes
# that contain methods and attributes:

from qgis.gui import QgisInterface


class Plugin:

    # TODO: check init params
    def __init__(self, iface: QgisInterface):
        """ Sets up the object """

        self.iface = iface
        self.__name = "cool plugin"

    def get_name(self) -> str:
        """ Returns the name attribute of the object """
        return self.__name

    def set_name(self, new_name: str) -> bool:
        """ Sets the name of the plugin """
        if "not cool" in new_name:
            print("Invalid name")
            return False

        else:
            self.__name = new_name
            return True


```

## Imports

Rule of thumb: always use *relative imports* when importing from other modules inside your QGIS plugin.
```{python, eval=FALSE}
from pathlib import Path  # standard library, this is fine
import numpy as np  # again, this is fine as the module exists elsewhere

from .plugin import Plugin  # this is ok
from ..test.conftest import new_project  # as is this


from TestPlugin.plugin import Plugin  # this does NOT work in QGIS plugins!

```
